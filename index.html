		<h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
		<p>
		Deet was largely based on the character of Thurma, a character from the scrapped The Power of the Dark Crystal movie: both were conceived as large-eyed heroines dwelling in an underground realm who venture to the surface world in order to save their respective people. According to Jeffrey Addiss, Deet was meant to act as the audience's "eyes and ears" into Thra's natural world, while Halle Stanford described her as "the ultimate environmental activist". The Deet puppet's eyes were so large, that there was no space in the head to incorporate servo-triggered eyelids, so the act of blinking had to be added digitally. Beccy Henderson incorporated green aventurine, a quartz popularly known as the "stone of opportunity", to Deet's clothing, in order to emphasize Deet's "confidence to change while reinforcing leadership qualities‚Äù.
